<p>A brief history of GC in .NET
The genesis of the garbage collector (GC) in .NET dates back to 1990 when Microsoft was developing its version of JavaScript, named JScript. Initially developed by a four-person team, one member, Patrick Dussud, who is recognized as the father of .NET‚Äôs garbage collector, developed a Conservative GC within the team. At that time, the CLR did not exist, and Patrick was working on the JVM.</p>
<p>Initially, Microsoft aimed to implement its version of the JVM instead of creating something akin to the current .NET runtime. However, once the CLR team was formed, they realized that the JVM imposed certain limitations on them, prompting the creation of their own environment.</p>
<p>With this decision, Patrick redeveloped a new GC from scratch, targeting the ‚Äúbest GC possible‚Äù concept, using LISP, his language of expertise. He then wrote a transpiler from LISP to C++ to make the code compatible with Microsoft‚Äôs runtime. (The birth of the CLR)</p>
<p>The current codes for the garbage collector used in .NET can be accessed from this file in Microsoft‚Äôs runtime repository. Today, Maoni Stephens, the technical lead of Microsoft‚Äôs GC team, who has written and presented many conferences and articles on various aspects of GC implementation, can be followed on her blog.</p>
<p>Currently, .NET is equipped with three modes (flavors) of GC, each optimized for different types of applications. Let‚Äôs dive into each of these:</p>
<p>Server GC
Optimized for server-side applications like ASP.NET Core and WCF, this variant of GC is designed for environments with high request rates and frequent object allocations and deallocations.</p>
<p>Server GC operates with a separate heap and a GC thread for each processor. This means that if you have an eight-core processor, there will be an independent heap and GC thread on each core during garbage collection.</p>
<p>This approach ensures the collection process is as swift as possible without additional pauses, preventing the application from ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù.</p>
<p>Server GC is only executable on multi-core processors. Attempting to run a server-side application in Server GC mode on a single-core processor will automatically result in a fallback to Non-Concurrent Workstation GC.</p>
<p>To use Server GC in non-server-side applications (like WPF, Windows Services, etc.) on multi-core processors, add the following settings to your app.config or web.config:</p>
